# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

For this project I had to refactor some starter code for a website given to me for my first week challenge. The importance of having a website with accessibility standards by having proper semantic html and structure, helps improves the websites SEO (Search Engine Optimization) by being ranked higher on search engines with recognizable keywords. It also offers people with disabilities ability to fully access the website and is just generally good for business. Removing <divs>, adding alt tags and grouping similiar classes was some of the main issues solved in this.
